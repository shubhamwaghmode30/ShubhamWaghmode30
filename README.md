## 🌱 **My Learning Journey**

My journey in technology is like connecting the dots — starting from fundamentals, evolving through creativity, and building impactful real-world solutions.

It began with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, where I crafted interactive, responsive web experiences. This evolved with Bootstrap & jQuery, enabling rapid prototyping and polished design.

Driven by curiosity, I explored Python for automation and AI integration, turning ideas into smarter solutions. Mastering C & C++ strengthened my logic and object oriented thinking, forming the foundation for complex systems.

This path led me to Database Management Systems, where SQL and MongoDB became tools to efficiently store and manage data. To make data meaningful, I explored Data Visualization using Excel and Power BI, transforming raw information into insights.

Finally, my curiosity drew me to Finance Markets & Algo Trading, merging coding, analytics, and strategy to develop intelligent trading systems.

Each step builds on the last, a continuous journey of learning, experimenting, and creating & aiming to bridge innovation with real-life impact.
